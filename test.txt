why exclusion he then turned to the way of Sufism which he notes to be both a knowledge and, 
even more fundamentally, a practice which constitutes a yet deeper knowledge. As practice, its 
goal is detachment from all else for the purpose of attachment to God. He attained information and 
some understanding of Sufism by reading the works of Makki, Muhasibi, Junayd, Shibli and 
Bistami. But he noted that the essence of Sufism was a matter not of knowledge, but of lived 
experience described as savoring the truth.   
Hence he had to reorient himself from an outward search for objective truth to the realization 
of an inward state of soul; it was not a matter of knowing the definition of detachment, but of 
becoming detached step by step. This spiritual turn was for him a matter of great drama and pain. 
He had always held the three great truths: The Existence of God, Prophecy, and Resurrection or 
the Last Day, and had stoutly taught and defended them. But he notes with regret that he had done 

so with attachment to worldly honor, even to the point of treating others harshly. If, however, 
eternal happiness depended not on attachment but on detachment, then he had a crucial choice to 
make: to remain with all the attachments of his life as leader of the school in Baghdad or to break 
away.  
The pressure of the growing awareness of this choice progressively paralyzed him over a six 
months period beginning from Rajab 488 to the point at which he could neither speak nor eat. At 
that point, by God's help, he was able to make the break. For the rest of his life he led the life of 
prayer. He was a hermit for two years in Syria and Palestine; he notes especially his time in the 
minaret of the mosque in Damascus. Family cares recalled him once again to his home, which he 
left but briefly to teach at Nishapur. But with progressive practice of the Sufi Way of self-denial, 
prayer and meditation in Tas, the spirit of God suffused him entirely.   
He recounts the stages of the Sufi Way as the purification of the heart of all that is not God 
and total absorption in God through annihilation of Self. Each interior step of the heart is 
accompanied by a corresponding step of knowledge unveiling and contemplating the truth. These 
take one to a proximity with God, but this is not yet the state of inherence or true union. For that 
it is necessary to proceed by lived, even savored, experience. This has three levels: (1) knowledge 
by faith or belief based on the good opinion one has of one's spiritual masters or teachers; (2) 
indirect knowledge by verification with the help of reasoning; (3) direct knowledge by taste, which 
he describes as tasted or savored in order to insist upon the subjectivity of an interior appreciation 
of God as present beyond any objective, exterior knowledge.  
All these levels are permeated by the notion of prophecy; it is the Prophet who achieves most 
vividly the direct experience of God which is the goal of the Sufi Way. Hence at this point he 
undertakes a detailed progressive analysis of the nature of prophecy in order to be as clear as 
possible regarding the reality of the divine union which is both the Way and the truth, both 
knowledge and practice, and, beyond all, life divine.
